# Telco Classification Project
 
# Plan -> Acquire -> Prepare -> Explore -> Model & Evaluate -> Deliver


# Objectives:
- Document all my code for data acquisition, data preparation, exploration, model & evaluation in a jupter notebook.
- Create modules (functions) that automate my process.
- Construct a machine learning model that can predict customer churn via classification technique.
- Deliver a 5 minute presentation via a jupyter notebook walkthrough for my audience, the data science team at CodeUp.
- Answer questions about my code, process, model and summary.

# Business Goals:
- To find a driver of churn for the Telco company.
- Create a machine learning model that can predict customer churn.
- Document my process and findings in a clean readable notebook.



## Plan
- Describe project and goals.
- Write out README plan.
- Write out each step.

## Acquire
- Acquire my dataframe.
- Creat necessary SQL query.
- Create a function for connection and acquiring dataframe.
- Complete initial data summaries.
- Plot distributions and individual variables.


## Prepare
- Clean up data.
- Address null values, erroneous data.
- Split data into train, validate, test.
- Create new features in dataframe such as:
  - feature that represents tenure in years
  - create variables or merge for phone service, dependents, etc..
- Import prepare.py and use it.

## Explore
- Figure out drivers of churn.
- Create ${H_0}$, run statistical testing.
- Create visualizations.
- Summarize findings and takeaways.

## Model & Evaluate
- Establish my baseline accuracy.
- Train and compare at least three different models.
- Select which model to use via validate data.
- Remove any unnecessary features (maybe)
- Test model of choice once.
- Summarize performance and document results.

## Deliver
- Project goals.
- Summarize findings, executive summary.
- Walk through analysis.
- Explain key takeaways.
- Answer questions about findings.
- Time limit is 5 minutes!
